## What is Tricksurf?

A spinoff mode formed from the Surf game mode, players can create and complete sequences of locations to surf to, known as tricks, for XP and bragging rights.

Unlike regular surf, tricksurf typically has loosely defined goals that are not intentionally placed by the author of the surf map. Sometimes the most fun part of tricksurf is developing new tricks that are flashy and difficult, and then challenging your friends.
